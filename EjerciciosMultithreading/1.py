'''Exercise 1: Using the multithreading module, write a simple python program as follows:
● Create a pool of threads to run concurrent tasks.
● The pool size should be 10.
● The thread should receive as input a number [id] (unique identifier for each of the
threads, starting from 1) and a number [number_of_writtings] (number of times the
thread will write the message).
● Each thread should sleep a random amount of time (between 100 and 300
milliseconds) and write the message ("I am 1", "I am 2", etc) a random number of times
between 5 and 15.'''

    for _ in range(number_of_writings):
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.3))  # Sleep for a random amount of time (between 100 and 300 milliseconds)
        print(f"I am {thread_id}")

    pool_size = 10

        threads.append(thread)
